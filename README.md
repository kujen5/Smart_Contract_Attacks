# Smart Contract Attacks
`Smart Contract Attacks` is a project created by myself in order to make people more aware regarding attacks that target Blockchain/Web3 and Smart Contracts.
You will find a folder specific to each vulnerability or class of vulnerabilities alongside explanations, code examples and mitigations.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement more vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Try to cover OWASP top 10 Smart Contract vulnerabilities
- [ ] Discover my own vulnerabilities ;)
